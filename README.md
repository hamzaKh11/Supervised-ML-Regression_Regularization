# Project Overview: Supervised Machine Learning with Regularization Techniques

In this project, we delve into the realm of supervised machine learning, focusing on regression analysis. Utilizing the power of Linear Regression, we aim to predict continuous outcomes based on input features. Recognizing the potential pitfalls of overfitting, we've incorporated regularization techniques to enhance the model's generalization capabilities. By balancing the trade-off between bias and variance, regularization ensures that our model remains robust and performs well on unseen data. This project serves as a testament to the efficacy of combining traditional regression methods with modern regularization techniques to achieve optimal predictive performance.
